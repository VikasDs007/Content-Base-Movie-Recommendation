## Data Preprocessing

The application will automatically:
- Handle missing values by filling with empty strings
- Clean text data (remove brackets, quotes)
- Process list-like strings for genres, directors, and stars
- Apply feature weighting for better recommendations

## Privacy and Legal

⚠️ **Important**: 
- Ensure you have the right to use your dataset
- Respect copyright and licensing terms
- Don't include personal or sensitive information
- Follow data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)

## File Size Recommendations

- **Small**: < 1MB (1K-5K movies) - Great for testing
- **Medium**: 1-50MB (5K-50K movies) - Good performance
- **Large**: 50-200MB (50K-100K movies) - May need optimization
- **Very Large**: > 200MB (100K+ movies) - Consider data sampling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **File not found error**
   - Ensure `movies.csv` is in the `data/` directory
   - Check file name spelling and case sensitivity

2. **Column missing error**
   - Verify all required columns are present
   - Check column name spelling

3. **Encoding issues**
   - Save CSV with UTF-8 encoding
   - Handle special characters properly

4. **Performance issues**
   - Consider reducing dataset size for testing
   - Use data sampling for very large datasets

### Data Quality Tips

- **Remove duplicates**: Ensure unique movie entries
- **Standardize formats**: Consistent date and rating formats
- **Clean text**: Remove HTML tags, special characters
- **Validate data**: Check for reasonable values (years, ratings)

## Example Datasets

For testing purposes, you can create a small sample dataset:

```python
import pandas as pd

sample_data = {
    'title': ['The Dark Knight', 'Inception', 'Pulp Fiction'],
    'year': [2008, 2010, 1994],
    'genres': ['Action, Crime, Drama', 'Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller', 'Crime, Drama'],
    'description': [
        'When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc...',
        'A thief who steals corporate secrets...',
        'The lives of two mob hitmen, a boxer...'
    ],
    'directors': ['Christopher Nolan', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Quentin Tarantino'],
    'stars': ['Christian Bale, Heath Ledger', 'Leonardo DiCaprio', 'John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson'],
    'rating': [9.0, 8.8, 8.9]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(sample_data)
df.to_csv('data/movies.csv', index=False)
```
